## Length Guidelines

### Too Short (needs expansion)
```
❌ Jane is a PhD student. She works on behavior.
```
**Issue**: Missing join date, education, specific research focus

### Appropriate Length
```
✓ Jane is a PhD student who joined the lab in September 2024. She received her BS in Neuroscience from MIT. Her research focuses on developing computational methods for behavioral analysis in mouse models.
```

### Too Long (needs trimming)
```
❌ Jane is a PhD student who joined the lab in September 2024. She received her BS in Neuroscience from MIT where she graduated summa cum laude with a 3.95 GPA and was on the Dean's List all four years. She also completed a minor in Computer Science and took advanced courses in machine learning, computer vision, and statistics. Her research focuses on developing computational methods for behavioral analysis in mouse models of neurodegenerative diseases, particularly ALS and Alzheimer's. She is using convolutional neural networks and transformer architectures to analyze video data at 30 fps with 14 keypoints tracked per animal across multiple animals simultaneously...
```
**Issue**: Too much detail on education, excessive technical specifics
