## Length Guidelines

### Too Short (needs expansion)
```
❌ Sarah is a programmer who joined in 2024. She works on SLEAP.
```
**Issue**: Missing education, specific projects, prior experience

### Appropriate Length
```
✓ Sarah is a scientific programmer who joined the lab in January 2024. She received her MS in Computer Science from Stanford. She is working on cloud infrastructure for SLEAP and developing scalable pose estimation pipelines. Prior to joining, she worked as a software engineer at Google for three years.
```

### Too Long (needs trimming)
```
❌ Sarah is a scientific programmer who joined the lab in January 2024 after an extensive career in industry. She received her MS in Computer Science from Stanford University in 2020 where she graduated with honors and published two papers on distributed systems. Prior to joining, she worked as a software engineer at Google for three years (2020-2023) where she was on the machine learning infrastructure team and contributed to projects involving TensorFlow, Kubernetes, and large-scale data pipelines. She has expertise in Python, C++, Java, JavaScript, Go, and Rust, as well as cloud platforms including AWS, GCP, and Azure. At Salk, she is working on cloud infrastructure for SLEAP, developing scalable pose estimation pipelines, optimizing GPU utilization, and building CI/CD systems...
```
**Issue**: Too much career detail, excessive technical specifics, too many projects listed

## Common Patterns

### Career Progression
```
BS from A → Industry at B → MS from C → Lab
PhD from A → Postdoc at B → Staff at Lab
BS from A → MS from B → RA at Lab → (PhD bound)
```

### Work Description Structure
```
Current projects → Prior experience → Technical expertise (if relevant)
```

### Joint Appointments
```
Main role → Joint with [Lab] → Projects spanning both
```

---

## What to Include

✅ Join date (month and year)
✅ Highest degree and institution
✅ Current projects/work focus
✅ Prior work experience (especially if industry or significant)
✅ Joint appointments if applicable
✅ Technical expertise if highly relevant

## What to Avoid

❌ Excessive list of technologies/languages
❌ Too much detail on prior jobs
❌ Every degree or certificate
❌ Job titles progression at prior employer
❌ Overly technical jargon
❌ Personal motivations or future goals

## Role-Specific Notes

### Programmers
- Emphasize technical projects and tools
- Mention software engineering background
- Can include primary technologies if core to work
- Highlight infrastructure/development work

### Staff Scientists
- More research-focused than programmers
- Emphasize scientific background and PhD work
- Describe research areas, not just tools
- Can mention prior postdoc/research positions

### Research Assistants
- Often more junior, transitioning roles
- May mention if planning grad school
- Focus on current work and learning
- Prior research experience relevant if notable
- Education might be just BS, that's fine
