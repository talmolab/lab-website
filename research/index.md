Our lab leverages **deep learning** and **computer vision** to study complex biological systems by **building novel computational tools**. Our core research areas of interest include:


{% capture text %}
We develop methods for **pose estimation and tracking** to [quantify animal behavior](https://talmopereira.com/publication/pereira-2020-review/pereira-2020-review.pdf).

To help others make use of this technology, we created [SLEAP](https://sleap.ai): an open-source framework for the entire multi-animal pose tracking workflow.

We develop tools to quantify traits in **complex morphologies** such as plant root systems. We are applying these technologies to [solve climate change](https://www.salk.edu/science/power-of-plants/) in collaboration with experimental labs in the [Salk Harnessing Plants Initiative](https://www.salk.edu/harnessing-plants-initiative/).

We are interested in exploring how artificial neural networks (**ANNs**) can be used as **models of biological neural circuits**. To do this, we combine agent-based modeling with imitation learning to take advantage of motion capture data to constrain our models. This work aims to improve our understanding of both **brains** and **ANNs**.
