## High school and undergraduate internships

Interested in doing research with us during the school year or for a summer? Reach out to [talmo@salk.edu](mailto:talmo@salk.edu) with your CV and research interests.

**UCSD students**: To work at Salk, you will need to enroll in a research for academic credit course such as [BISP 199](https://biology.ucsd.edu/education/undergrad/research/research-acad-cred/), [COGS 199](https://cogsci.ucsd.edu/undergraduates/student-resources/research.html) or [CSE 199](https://cse.ucsd.edu/undergraduate/cse199-independent-study-undergraduates). Make sure to check out the [general requirements for enrollment](https://students.ucsd.edu/academics/enroll/special-enrollment/special-studies-classes.html).

We especially recommend that UCSD students considering working with us for a longer period of time apply for the [Triton Research & Experiential Learning Scholars (TRELS) program](https://ugresearch.ucsd.edu/research-programs/trels/index.html). This opportunity provides funding to conduct and present your research.
