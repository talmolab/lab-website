Hi, I'm Talmo. I run a lab as a [Salk Fellow](https://www.salk.edu/news-release/salk-fellows-program-welcomes-talmo-pereira/) at the [Salk Institute for Biological Studies](https://salk.edu), where we use computer vision and deep learning to study animal behavior, neuroscience, and plants!

I received my **PhD in Neuroscience** at the [Princeton Neuroscience Institute](https://pni.princeton.edu), co-advised by [Mala Murthy](https://murthylab.princeton.edu) and [Joshua Shaevitz](https://shaevitzlab.princeton.edu).
