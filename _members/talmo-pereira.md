Hi, I'm Talmo. I run a lab as a [Salk Fellow](https://www.salk.edu/news-release/salk-fellows-program-welcomes-talmo-pereira/) at the [Salk Institute for Biological Studies](https://salk.edu), where we use computer vision and deep learning to study animal behavior, neuroscience, and plants!

I received my **BS in Bioinformatics and Computational Biology** from the University of Maryland, Baltimore County. I received my **PhD in Neuroscience** at the [Princeton Neuroscience Institute](https://pni.princeton.edu), co-advised by [Mala Murthy](https://murthylab.princeton.edu) and [Joshua Shaevitz](https://shaevitzlab.princeton.edu).

## Bio

> Dr. Talmo Pereira is a Principal Investigator at the Salk Institute for Biological Studies in San Diego, CA where he leads a research group as a Salk Fellow. His lab ([talmolab.org](https://talmolab.org)) focuses on the development of deep learning-based computational methods for recognition and modeling of complex biological systems, with applications ranging from neuroscience to cancer and plant biology. His recent work has demonstrated how advances in deep learning and computer vision can enable quantitative phenotyping of complex behaviors through the development and application of approaches for markerless motion capture ([sleap.ai](https://sleap.ai)). This work has been published in Nature Methods and featured in The Scientist, Nature Lab Animal, Nature Toolbox, Quanta Magazine and others. Prior to joining Salk, Talmo worked as a research intern in Perception at Google AI working on pose-based action recognition, and received his PhD in Neuroscience from Princeton University where he was also a recipient of the NSF Graduate Research Fellowship and the Porter Ogden Jacobus Fellowship -- Princeton University's top graduate student honor.
